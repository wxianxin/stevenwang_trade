    <p>In my opinion, AMD is a company with great vision of the future. Sometimes she places too much emphasis upon the technology of tomorrow, just like me.

    <p>AMD is the only company that makes both CPU and GPU for PC and server. However, AMD hasn't been doing very well comparing to its opponents Intel and Nvidia. But I believe AMD is fighting back, at least in the stock market.</p>

    <p>Intel is the dominant player in x86 CPU market despite his failed attempt in the mobile market. Intel has the most advanced technology of semiconductor device fabrication process, 14nm. Even though Samsung also allege they have 14nm, but apparently it is not as good as Intel's. So, Intel designs his own CPU and produces his own CPU.</p>
    <p>On the other side, AMD sold her factory, GlobalFoundries(GF), to ATIC, a company owned by UAE, in 2009. So AMD only designs her CPU and give production to GF. AMD is stuck by 28nm node for the past few years. In the mean time Intel's 3rd and 4th generation CPUs are based on 22nm and 5th and 6th generation are based on 14nm. Fabrication process node is a decisive factor of CPU's performance and power consumption, so Intel is overwhelming.</p>
    <p>The structure of AMD's CPU is also a bit too futuristic. It heavily depends on the programmer's effort to take advantage of this design. However, things did not develop in the way that AMD would prefer. Programmers didn't seem to favor AMD.</p>

    <p>In GPU market, Nvidia has the upper hand. Nvidia's products have lower TDP and better overall performance if PC gaming. Considering both AMD and Nvidia GPUs are based on same TSMC 28nm process, this is not good for AMD. Nvidia is also working on HPC market, where AMD has little market share.</p>
    <p>In terms of chip designs, AMD's GPU tend to have more cores comparing to Nvidia's product.(GPU is a chip for parallel computing. A normal GPU may have thousands of cores on a single die.) Even though, AMD is having a hard time catching up.</p>

    <p>Things are changing now. This year both AMD and Nvidia are moving towards better fabrication node. Nvidia still goes with TSMC and its 16nm technology, while AMD is working with GF and its 14nm process.(GF's 14nm is authorized Samsung's technology). Both companies's products have a big leap in performance. Even though this time again it seems that TSMC's 16nm is a lot better than GF's 14nm in terms of clock speed. The release of Vulkan and Nvidia's incapability in Asynchronous Computing(Async) give AMD a chance.</p>

    <p>As I mentioned, AMD has a vision for future, even though sometimes it won't pay off. But when it does pay off, it will be big. AMD released Mental API in 2013, a low level API that programmers can better utilize the hardware with better efficiency and performance. Then, Microsoft announced DX12, successor of DX11, an API almost every game is based on. People believe AMD has a significant role in the development of DX12, which means DX12 will include a lot of features in Mental. What's more, Khronos group also released Vulkan API, aiming to provide cross-platform low-level GPU hardware control, which AMD again is the main contributor. Recent games shows a big improvement for AMD GPU for games that utilize Vulkan. Among these new APIs, async is one of the core features, which is also AMD's focus, but not Nvidia's. Nvidia's products shows little performance gain when using Async.</p>

    <p>We have to acknowledge that for now, Nvidia's GPU is overall better than AMD's counterpart, which we can also learn by looking at the premium price of Nvidia's product besides doing performance benchmarks. But this would be enough for the stock market.</p>

    <p>By 2017, AMD will also release its highly anticipated CPU, Zen. This new generation of CPU that will be based on GF's 14nm process. Which I am almost sure that it will not be as good as Intel's 14nm, especially in terms of clock speed. And overall AMD's single core performance will still falls behind Intel's CPU. However, AMD is bringing 8-core 16-thread (8C16T) to regular desktop platform with a unified AM4 socket, comparing Intel's 4C8T for now. Regardless of Intel, the transition from 28nm to 14nm is big enough for a huge improvement. AMD allege there is 40% increase in IPC, a number reflecting the raw performance of a CPU. AMD also has a new chip design that no more includes ideas that are too futuristic. The Zen lineup also consists of 16C32T and 32C64T server CPUs, which seems to be promising because there is no direct competion from Intel of CPU with this many core count and hopefully AMD will get back some market share in the server market.</p>

    <p>In the console market, AMD also takes the entire market for next generation consoles, by being the sole chip provider for both Xbox(Codenamed Scorpio with RX480) and PlayStation(Codenamed NEO also with RX480).(If omitting wii.)</p>
    <p>It is also worth mentioning that AMD has been the sole GPU provider for Apple in its Mac PC lineup.</p>

    <p>Moreover, one of AMD's Advantage is its HSA technology. An example of this is AMD's APU. It is a CPU with added GPU on its die. Both the CPU and GPU can access the same RAM address. And it has much better graphics performance than Intel's counterpart.</p>
    <p>AMD is trpling the budget for market promotion and it is working with some Chinese companies that might turn into very good earnings and profits.</p>

    <p>Under the leadership of AMD's CEO Lisa Su, AMD is trying get back in the game. And I think $5.5 for a share of AMD's stock is a much undervalued price. AMD had a really bad time for the past few years, I believe any good news would simulate its share price.</p>
